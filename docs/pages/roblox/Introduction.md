# ✏️ Writing Lune Scripts for Roblox

Lune has a powerful built-in library and set of APIs for manipulating Roblox place files and model files. It contains APIs for reading & writing files, and gives you instances to use, just as if you were scripting inside of the Roblox engine, albeit with a more limited API.

For examples on how to write Roblox-specific Lune scripts, check out the [Examples](https://lune.gitbook.io/lune/roblox/examples) page.

For a full list of the currently implemented Roblox APIs, check out the [API Status](https://lune.gitbook.io/lune/roblox/api-status) page.
